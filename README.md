![Alt Text](./images/Screenshot%202022-07-27%20080854.png)

This stack is a sample from [Serverless Land](https://serverlessland.com/patterns/apigw-lambda-dynamodb-xray-cdk). This CDK application demonstrates how to integrate X-Ray SDK in Lambda functions to observe into downstream API calls.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

## Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
